Tomorrow, I start my sophomore year of high school.
And believe it or not, I’m really not that afraid of going.
I’m not sure if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to “participate.”
So, if this does end up being my last letter, please believe that things are good with me, and even when they’re not, they will be soon enough.
And I will believe the same about you.
Love always,
Charlie
